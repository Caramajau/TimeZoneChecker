# Time Zone Checker
This is a simple JavaFX application that allows the user to check the current time in different time zones. This mostly exists since I wanted to learn how date and time works in Java. But if you want to use this instead of just googling the time in different time zones, feel free to do so.

## Features
- You can select time and date in different time zones, and then see the converted date in your time zone.
- That is it.

## How to run
### Prerequisites
- Java 20 or later.
- If you want to run it as the project, you will need Maven and your favourite Java IDE (below is a guide for IntelliJ).
- I think that is it.

### Running the jar
Download the jar from the releases page and run it with `java -jar TimeZoneChecker.jar`.

### Run configuration for IntelliJ
Create a new run configuration where: 
- the working directory is set to TimeZoneChecker
- the command is javafx:run.
